# Adaptation Manifolds
This repo contains the accompanying code for the preprint "[Distinct patterns of cortical manifold expansion and contraction underlie human sensorimotor adaptation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.09.495516v1)", which explores changes in cortical functional architecture during sensorimotor adaptation using functional connecitivity manifolds.
